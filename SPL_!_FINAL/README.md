# protect.spl
3rd semester spl project (Whiteboard):

1. Open terminal and the associated directory

2. Put command: bash run_server.sh to initiate the connection by server by commands inside shell file
  it will return the ip address of the server

3. Now open another (one or more terminal according to the number of users in the same machine or differnt
  machine inside same network) terminal, go to associated directory, 
  then put the command: bash run_client.shto join a user.

4. To be connected, the user will need to input the ip address of the server 

5. Thus, a connection will be establish between multiple users(clients) through server.

6. Now users can send text, share files, set own nickname, send private messages using
   user id, see active clients counts which will be exhibited on the server window.
7. To test, if file can be sent or not, I also attached a demo file named file.txt to check that case.
